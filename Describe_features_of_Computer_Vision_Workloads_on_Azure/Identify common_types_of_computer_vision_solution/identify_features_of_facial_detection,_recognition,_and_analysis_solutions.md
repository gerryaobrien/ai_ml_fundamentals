# Identify Features of Facial Detection, Recognition, and Analysis Solutions

When it comes to facial detection, Microsoft offers the Azure Face service as well as the ability to perform face detection using the Computer Vision API.  But what is face detection.  The service offers pre-built algorithms that anybody can use to detect, recognize, and analyze human faces in the images that you send to the service.  In terms of face detection, you can ask the service to return the rectangle coordinates for any human faces that are found in an image.  Another option is to request a series of attributes related to faces such as:

- the head pose
- the gender of the detected faces
- a guess at an age
- what emotion is displayed
- if there is facial hair or the person is wearing glasses
